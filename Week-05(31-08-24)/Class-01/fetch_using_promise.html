<!-- 
//fetch is used to make the backend -background calls what it mainly does is that it can make several types
//of request to the backend it can make GET,POST,PUT,DELETE requests to the backend..
//Fetch generally is an Async operation and can be called and maybe resolved in various ways 
//We can suse normal promises as well -->

            //firstly wo ek URL lega jo ki btaega ki fetch krna kahan se hai and then it has bunch of options regarding method 
            //that we want to use like GET,POST,PUT,DELETE and all then we have other  thing like encoding nd stuff

                //so as fetch is an ASynchronous task so it return a promise and when the promise is resolved it returns us a respose
                //that response is not in jSON format so we use .then(response=> return respone.json()) to conver it into json
                //since .json() is also an Async task so it also kind of returns a promise which when resolved then we call .then
                //and we log the actual value
                //here we use the methodology of promise chaining 
                //Keep in mind that in FETCH ->We use 2 .then and 2 Async operation is carried out.....

                    //in the backend we do this .... we make fetch call and then async fetch is carried out and then
                    // we see this working out like the fetched data/posts are posted on screen using DOM manipulation
